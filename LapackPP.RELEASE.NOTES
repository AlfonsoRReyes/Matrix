    Lapack++ v. 1.1a


WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.1.a
---------------------------

Version 1.1a is a bug-fix release, reflecting changes
C++ compiler support:


o) removed generic.h dependencies (used in early C++ compilers)
o) changed X::X(&X) constructor to X::X(const &X) in utgmd.h,
		ltgmd.h, ultgmd.h, uutmgd.h, 
o) reordered members in several matrix objects to coincide with
	constructor argument ordering.
o) removed unused variables (generated warnings on
		some compilers)
