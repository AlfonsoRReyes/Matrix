This package requires the Fortran LAPACK library version 3.0 available
in source form and in compiled form for some systems at
		    http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
The configure script for this package attempts to detect the lapack
library and the Atlas or BLAS libraries.  Please tell us if this does
not work for you.
